    <h2>Recipe</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat small and medium sized pans at low-medium heat (3/4 on dial).</li>
            <li>Mix together eggs and milk with a pinch of salt and pepper.</li>
            <li>Once both pans are heated, put 1 Tablespoon of butter into large pan and 1/2 tablespoon of butter into small pan coating evenly.</li>
            <li>Once both pants are heated, put mushrooms into small pan and eggs into medium pan.</li>
            <li>Pinch some salt and pepper in with mushrooms as they cook. You can flip over larger slices of mushrooms too.</li>
            <li>Once eggs have cooked through, turn heat down a smidge and throw most of your shredded cheese onto one half of the omelette.</li>
            <li>Once mushrooms are cooked, place them on top of shredded cheese.</li>
            <li>Flip the omelette over once eggs are completely solidified.</li>
            <li>Let cook for a couple minutes, then flip over to cook opposite side.</li>
            <li>I like to serve with toast and coffee!</li>
        </ol>
